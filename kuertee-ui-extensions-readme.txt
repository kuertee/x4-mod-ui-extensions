Updates
=======
v7.0.021, 12 Jul 2024:
-Bug-fix: some mods (e.g. my Trade Analytics) were trying to update the Transaction Log menu even when it wasn't open.

v7.0.02, 28 Jun 2024:
-Compatibility: Requires base game v7.00 HF 1.

Instructions for players
========================
Just install UI Extensions as normal - that is IF you have a mod that requires UI Extensions.
You don't need UI Extensions if you're not using mods that require UI Extensions.
When extracting the package from github, ensure that the folder you install the mod to is: "game/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/".
Extracting the package from Nexus Mods will extract it to "game/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/". But be sure it does anyway.

Instructions for developers
===========================
An overview on how to mod for UIX:
1. Install the mod as a player.
2. Copy the "game/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/ui" folder into the "game/ui" folder. This will overwrite UIX's XPL files into the game.
3. Launch the game with the "-prefersinglefiles" option. This will make the game use UIX XPL files instead of the base game's corresponding files that are in its cat/dat files.
4. Examine one of the callbacks in any of those XPL files. Search for "callback". Add any callback you need in any of the XPL files IN THE GAME FOLDER. If you need a add callbacks to a menu file that UIX doesn't have let me know (on Discord, Nexus or kuertee@gmail.com).
5. When done adding your callbacks, send me the changed XPL files.
6. I'll merge them with the master UIX files.
7. We'll coordinate release dates so that the new UIX mod with your callbacks is released near the time you release your mod.

An an alternative installation instructions for advanced developers:
1. Pull the github files into the "game/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions" folder.
2. To copy the UIX XPL files that are in "game/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/ui" to the "game/ui" folder, run the "dev-make_symlink_files.bat". This will copy-linked files from UIX's folder into the game folder. Any changes you make in the UIX folder will be automatically mirrored in the files in the game folder.
3. Examine one of the callbacks in any of those XPL files. Search for "callback". Add any callback you need in any of the XPL files IN THE MOD FOLDER. If you need a add callbacks to a menu file that UIX doesn't have let me know (on Discord, Nexus or kuertee@gmail.com).
4. When done adding your callbacks, commit your changes to github.
5. We'll coordinate release dates so that the new UIX mod with your callbacks is released near the time you release your mod.

Any questions, it's best to @ me on Egosoft's unofficial Discord modding channel: https://discord.gg/RzAGhcY

Mod-specific lua files
======================
The actual lua that modifies the UI need to exist in the mod's lua file in the mod's folder.
The file needs to be named the lua file it will be modding.
Extract and examine "kuertee_uix_mod_sample.ZIP".
It adds a "Hello world" menu item in both the left and right side bars of the Map Menu.
In this example, the lua file is named: "menu_map_uix.lua" because it will be modding the base-game's "menu_map.lua" file.

Features
========
Modded Lua files with callbacks that allow more than one mod to change the same UI element.

Functionality that adds HUD elements to the Top Level Menu.

Allows other mods to create guidance missions (i.e. missiontype.guidance) that will be listed in the Guidance Missions tab. Also enables the Set Active and Set Inactive buttons in missions listed in the Guidance Missions tab. Examples of these are my mods: Loot mining, Ship scanner, Signal leak hunter - increasing range, Station scanner, and Waypoint fields for deployments.

Mod effects
===========
This is a modder's resource/API. By itself, this mod does not affect the game.

Modders can use this API to mod the game's Lua files that helps compatibility with other mods that also use this API.

Without this API, some Lua elements can be modified by only one mod. For example, my mods, "NPC reactions: NPC taxis" and "Teleport from transporter room" add buttons to the bottom of the Transporter Room panel. Because its Lua's display () function constructs its frame, table, rows, and content AND THEN immediately calls the frame:display () function, it is impossible for both mods to "rewrite" the display () function and expect both "rewrites" to work.

With this API, specifically its callbacks, it is possible.

Files in this API will be referred to as UIXs.

Summary of how to use
=====================
In the mod's Lua file:
----------------------
1. Create a pointer to the base game's menu to be modded.
2. Register a callback.
3. Write your changes in the callback.
4. Return what the callback expects - if it expects any.

5. If a new callback is required in a function that already exists in the UIXs, simply insert a new callback where it's needed.

6. If a new callback is required in a function that DOESN'T yet exists in the UIX, copy the function from the base game's menu.
7. Paste that function in the relevant UIX.
8. Insert the callback where it's needed.
9. Push your changes to Git.

In the mod's MD file:
---------------------
1. Load the UIX required with SirNukes Mod Support APIs. For example: <raise_lua_event name="'Lua_Loader.Load'" param="'extensions.kuertee_ui_extensions.ui.kuertee_menu_transporter'" />
2. Load the mod's Lua with SirNukes Mod Support APIs. For example: <raise_lua_event name="'Lua_Loader.Load'" param="'extensions.kuertee_npc_reactions.ui.kuertee_npc_reactions'"/>

In your mod's release:
----------------------
Make this mod a required download for your mod.

Documentation
=============
Soon.

But the callbacks, along with their function parameters and their expected returns, are listed in each of the new Lua files. Learning at which point in the code they execute is as easy as searching for them in the code. Examples of how they are used can be seen in my mods that use them. My mods "NPC reactions/NPC taxi" and "Teleport from transporter room" both have changes to the "TransporterMenu".

But here is documentation on NEW features (not connected to mod-specific changes via call-backs) that UIX offers.

CHANGES BUILT INTO THIS MOD
===========================

Map Menu: Sort by distance
==========================
The Player Owned list can be sorted by distance from the player or from the last selected object.
Note that Egosoft's sorting icons (the up and down arrows) signify direction of the list NOT ascending descending orders.
E.g. The down arrow actually sorts the list in ascending order. The list is sorted from least to greatest.

Map Menu: Mission Guidance tab
==============================
Any mission with the "missiontype.guidance" will now be listed in the Mission Guidance tab.
In the base game, the Mission Guidance tab lists only the Guidance created manually with the right-click mouse button. 

The "Set to inactive" and "Set to active" buttons are available on missions listed in the Mission Guidance tab.
The base game makes these buttons unavailable for Guidance Missions.

Map Menu: selectComponent mode
==============================
The selectComponent mode is now available to use from directly within the Map Menu. In the base game, the use of this mode is limited to conversations triggered from the Mission Director (md). E.g. &lt;open_conversation_menu menu="MapMenu" param="[0, 0, true, player.entity, null, 'selectComponent', ['kTFTR_set_destination', [class.ship_s, class.ship_m, class.ship_l, class.ship_xl, class.station]]]" /&gt;. Which then triggers an "event_conversation_next_section" with the menu.modeparam[1] as the section of the conversation. In this version, this mode can be called directly from the Map Menu.

To use:
1. Call "mapMenu.setSelectComponentMode (returnsection, classlist, category, playerowned, customheading, screenname)"
2. The parameters are described at the top of the base game's menu_map.lua file. They are described in more detail at the top of UIX's kuertee_menu_map.lua file.
3. To trigger an "AddUITriggeredEvent" after the player selects an object, set screenname in the mapMenu.setSelectComponentMode call.
4. To disable the default "event_conversation_next_section" after the player selects an object, set returnsection to nil in the mapMenu.setSelectComponentMode call.

Add Custom Actions/Orders Group to the Interact Menu (via MD)
======================================================
1. Load UIX's customised Interact Menu with: <raise_lua_event name="'Lua_Loader.Load'" param="'extensions.kuertee_ui_extensions.ui.kuertee_menu_interactmenu'"/>
2. At <event_ui_triggered screen="'UIXInteractMenu'" control="'loaded'" />, add the Custom Actions/Orders below.
3. Add the new Custom Actions/Orders Group Id <raise_lua_event name="'Interact_Menu_API.Add_Custom_Actions_Group_Id'" param="'my_custom_actions_group_id'" />
4. Add the new Custom Actions/Orders Group Name <raise_lua_event name="'Interact_Menu_API.Add_Custom_Actions_Group_Text'" param="'My Custom Actions/Orders Group'" />
5. Use the new id in Mod Support API's Add_Action function like this:
					<signal_cue_instantly cue="md.Interact_Menu_API.Add_Action" param = "table[
						$id = 'my_custom_action_1,
						$section = 'my_custom_actions_group_id',
						$text = 'My Custom Action 1',
						$mouseover = 'My Custom Action 1 mouse over',
						$callback = My_Custom_Action_1_Cue
					]" />
					<signal_cue_instantly cue="md.Interact_Menu_API.Add_Action" param = "table[
						$id = 'my_custom_action_2,
						$section = 'my_custom_actions_group_id',
						$text = 'My Custom Action 1',
						$mouseover = 'My Custom Action 2 mouse over',
						$callback = My_Custom_Action_2_Cue
					]" />
6. The custom commands will be added to both the Custom Actions and Custom Orders sub-menus.
7. To add only to one sub-menu and not the other, start the section name with either "actions_" or "orders_". E.g. "actions_my_custom_actions" will add the custom action to only the Custom Actions sub-menu. And "orders_my_custom_orders" will add the custom order to only the Custom Orders sub-menu.

Requirements
============
SirNukes Mod Support APIs mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/503) - to load the custom Lua files

Install
=======

Uninstall
=========
-Delete the mod folder.

Troubleshooting
===============
(1) Do not change the file structure of the mod. If you do, you'll need to troubleshoot problems you encounter yourself.
(2) Allow the game to log events to a text file by adding "-debug all -logfile debug.log" to its launch parameters.
(3) Enable the mod-specific Debug Log in the mod's Extension Options.
(4) Play for long enough for the mod to log its events.
(5) Send me (at kuertee@gmail.com) the log found in My Documents\Egosoft\X4\(your player-specific number)\debug.log.

-Also for "selectComponent" mode, if menu.modeparam[1] is nil, the next conversation section will not trigger.
