Updates
=======
v8.0.2.0, 16 Oct 2025:
- New feature: Callbacks for Forleyor's new mod.
- Bug-fix: Re-added Mycu's callback, which I removed accidentally earlier this year, for Verbose Transaction Log mod.
- New feature: Callbacks in the Diplomacy menu for Additional Agent Actions mod.
- Tweak: Ship Configuration menu: remove component types from the left bar for hardpoints the selected ship macro don't have.

NOTES FOR PLAYERS:
==================
Disable Protected UI Mode BEFORE activating this mod.
Unfortunately, due to how this mod is built, disabling or enabling Protected UI Mode WHILE the mod is active will prevent the menus from loading.

NOTES FOR MOD DEVELOPERS:
=========================
1. PROTECTED UI MODE: Mods that use UI Extensions will need the Protected UI Mode setting in the Extensions menu disabled.
2. LOADING CUSTOM LUAS: ModSupportAPIs' `Lua_Loader` (and in extension its `<raise_lua_event name="'Lua_Loader.Load'" param="'X'"/>)` no longer function.
3. UI.XML FILE: To load custom lua files, use ui.xml as described here: https://wiki.egosoft.com:1337/X%20Rebirth%20Wiki/Modding%20support/UI%20Modding%20support/Getting%20started%20guide/
   - Note that guideline is for X Rebirth. But its use in X4 is similar.[/li]
   - Here is the extensions\kuertee_alternatives_to_death\ui.xml file for my mod Alternatives To Death:
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <addon name="kuertee_alternatives_to_death" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../../ui/core/addon.xsd">
     <environment type="menus">
       <file name="ui/gameoptions_uix.lua" />
       <file name="ui/menu_toplevel_uix.lua" />
       <dependency name="ego_detailmonitor" />
     </environment>
   </addon>
   ```
   - With the game now loading custom lua files (instead of UIX loading them), make sure that any init() functions are called after they are loaded.
   - note: Pre 7.5 UIX loaded and, if set-up a particular way like my mods are, UIX also called their init() functions.
   - E.g. instead of "return ModLua" at the bottom of my mods' custom lua files, I now call "ModLua.init()". E.g.: kuertee_uix_mod_sample from UIX's Nexus Mods page (https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/552).

Instructions for players
========================
- Disable Protected UI Mode in the Settings > Extensions menu.
- Install UI Extensions as normal.
- When extracting the package from github, ensure that the folder you install the mod to is: "(X4 game)/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/". Extracting the package from Nexus Mods will extract it to "(X4 game)/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/". But be sure it does anyway.
- Read the CHANGES BUILT INTO THIS MOD (for players) section.

Instructions for developers
===========================
An overview on how to mod for UIX:
1. Install the mod as a player.
2. Copy the "(X4 game)/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/ui" folder into the "(X4 game)/ui" folder. This will overwrite UIX's XPL files into the game.
3. Launch the game with the "-prefersinglefiles" option. This will make the game use UIX XPL files instead of the base game's corresponding files that are in its cat/dat files.
4. Examine one of the callbacks in any of those XPL files. Search for "callback". Add any callback you need in any of the XPL files IN THE GAME FOLDER. If you need any callbacks added to a menu file that UIX doesn't have let me know (on Discord, Nexus or kuertee@gmail.com).
5. When done adding your callbacks, send me the changed XPL files.
6. I'll merge them with the master UIX files.
7. We'll coordinate release dates so that the new UIX mod with your callbacks is released near the time you release your mod.

Alternative installation instructions for advanced developers:
1. Pull the github files into the "(X4 game)/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions" folder.
2. To copy the UIX XPL files that are in "(X4 game)/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/ui" to the "game/ui" folder, run the "dev-make_symlink_files.bat". This will copy-linked files from UIX's folder into the game folder. Any changes you make in the UIX folder will be automatically mirrored in the files in the game folder.
3. Examine one of the callbacks in any of those XPL files. Search for "callback". Add any callback you need in any of the XPL files IN THE MOD FOLDER. If you need any add callbacks to a menu file that UIX doesn't have let me know (on Discord, Nexus or kuertee@gmail.com).
4. When done adding your callbacks, commit your changes to github.
5. We'll coordinate release dates so that the new UIX mod with your callbacks is released near the time you release your mod.

For any questions, it's best to @ me on Egosoft's unofficial Discord modding channel: https://discord.gg/RzAGhcY

Read the CHANGES BUILT INTO THIS MOD sections.

Features
========
Modded Lua files with callbacks that allow more than one mod to change the same UI element.

Functionality that adds HUD elements to the Top Level Menu.

Allows other mods to create guidance missions (i.e. missiontype.guidance) that will be listed in the Guidance Missions tab. Also enables the Set Active and Set Inactive buttons in missions listed in the Guidance Missions tab. Examples of these are my mods:
- Loot mining.
- Ship scanner.
- Signal leak hunter - increasing range.
- Station scanner.
- Waypoint fields for deployments.

Mod effects
===========
This is a modder's resource/API. By itself, this mod does not affect the game.

Modders can use this API to mod the game's Lua files that and helps compatibility with other mods that also use this API.

Without this API, some Lua elements can only be modified by one mod. For example, my mods, "NPC reactions: NPC taxis" and "Teleport from transporter room" add buttons to the bottom of the Transporter Room panel. Because its Lua's display () function constructs its frame, table, rows, and content AND THEN immediately calls the frame:display () function, it is impossible for both mods to "rewrite" the display () function and expect both "rewrites" to work.

With this API, specifically its callbacks, it is possible.

Files in this API will be referred to as UIXs.

Summary of how to use
=====================
In the mod's Lua file:
- ---------------------
1. Create a pointer to the base game's menu to be modded.
2. Register a callback.
3. Write your changes in the callback.
4. Return what the callback expects - if it expects any.
5. If a new callback is required in a function that already exists in the UIXs, simply insert a new callback where it's needed.
6. If a new callback is required in a function that DOESN'T yet exists in the UIX, copy the function from the base game's menu.
7. Paste that function in the relevant UIX.
8. Insert the callback where it's needed.
9. Push your changes to Git.

Load the UIX and the mod's lua file:
- --------------------
**v7.5 and upwards:**

Specify the UI file to be loaded in the mod's ui/ui.xml file (See **v7.5 NOTES FOR PLAYERS** section above).

**Pre v7.5:**

In the mod's MD file:
1. Load the UIX required with SirNukes Mod Support APIs. For example: <raise_lua_event name="'Lua_Loader.Load'" param="'extensions.kuertee_ui_extensions.ui.kuertee_menu_transporter'" />
2. Load the mod's Lua with SirNukes Mod Support APIs. For example: <raise_lua_event name="'Lua_Loader.Load'" param="'extensions.kuertee_npc_reactions.ui.kuertee_npc_reactions'"/>

In your mod's release:
- ---------------------
Make this mod a required download for your mod.

Documentation
=============
Soon.

But the callbacks, along with their function parameters and their expected returns, are listed in each of the new Lua files. Learning at which point in the code they execute is as easy as searching for them in the code. Examples of how they are used can be seen in my mods that use them. My mods "NPC reactions/NPC taxi" and "Teleport from transporter room" both have changes to the "TransporterMenu".

But here is documentation on NEW features (not connected to mod-specific changes via call-backs) that UIX offers.

CHANGES BUILT INTO THIS MOD (for players)
=========================================

Map Menu: Distance tool
=======================
- Click on an object or a position on the map or on a list.
- Right-click on another object or another position on the map.
- The distance or the number jumps between the two points will be listed.

Map Menu: Mission lists
=======================
Mission lists have an "open all/close all" button.

Map Menu: Multi-rename
======================
Note: Like the base game's single-rename function, confirming a blank entry will to revert an object's name to its default name.

When renaming multiple objects, these special texts in the name will be replaced with the listed value.
- $name: The object's current name.
- $name_AR: The object's internal name used with UniTrader's Advanced Renaming.
- $i: The object's position in the list based on descending DPS value.

Examples:
- "Red $i" will name all the objects "Red X" in which X is the object's order in the list.
- "$name $i" will add the object's order in the list to the object's current name.

Map Menu: Sort by distance
==========================
The Player Owned list can be sorted by distance from the player or from the last selected object.
Note that Egosoft's sorting icons (the up and down arrows) signify direction of the list NOT ascending descending orders.
E.g. The down arrow actually sorts the list in ascending order. The list is sorted from least to greatest.

Map Menu: Mission Guidance tab
==============================
Any mission with the "missiontype.guidance" will now be listed in the Mission Guidance tab.
In the base game, the Mission Guidance tab lists only the Guidance created manually with the right-click mouse button. 

The "Set to inactive" and "Set to active" buttons are available on missions listed in the Mission Guidance tab.
The base game makes these buttons unavailable for Guidance Missions.

Map Menu: Center On Map / Destination
=====================================
Right-click on an object and click on Center On Map to center the object on the map without changing your selected objects. This is usable on sectors. When used on a gate, the Center On Destination action centers the gate's destination. (Based on Brinnie's mod request: https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=471439&sid=a3f501f4bd3cc9a74a01dd4eb5107998.)

Map Menu: Zoom Function Tweaks
==============================
1. Reset To Top View: Current function: pan the map to the player. This is unchanged from the base-game.
2. Zone View: Current function: zoom in across 7 zoom levels. Overriden base-game function: Pan the map to the player at a zoom level approximating a zone view of the player's location.
3. Sector View: Current function: zoom out across 7 zoom levels. Overridden base-game function: Pan the map to the player at a zoom level approximating a sector view of the player's location.
4. Double-clicking an object on the map will toggle between 2 zoom levels:
  - "near view"
  - and "zone view" that shows a good portion of the zone
5. Double-clicking a sector on the map will toggle between 2 zoom levels:
  - "sector view" that always shows the icons of major object,
  - and a "local cluster view".

CHANGES BUILT INTO THIS MOD (for developers)
============================================

Map Menu: selectComponent mode
==============================
The selectComponent mode is now available to use from directly within the Map Menu. In the base game, the use of this mode is limited to conversations triggered from the Mission Director (md). E.g. `<open_conversation_menu menu="MapMenu" param="[0, 0, true, player.entity, null, 'selectComponent', ['kTFTR_set_destination', [class.ship_s, class.ship_m, class.ship_l, class.ship_xl, class.station]]]" />`. Which then triggers an "event_conversation_next_section" with the menu.modeparam[1] as the section of the conversation. In this version, this mode can be called directly from the Map Menu.

To use:
1. Call "mapMenu.setSelectComponentMode (returnsection, classlist, category, playerowned, customheading, screenname)"
2. The parameters are described at the top of the base game's menu_map.lua file. They are described in more detail at the top of UIX's kuertee_menu_map.lua file.
3. To trigger an "AddUITriggeredEvent" after the player selects an object, set screenname in the mapMenu.setSelectComponentMode call.
4. To disable the default "event_conversation_next_section" after the player selects an object, set returnsection to nil in the mapMenu.setSelectComponentMode call.

Add Custom Actions/Orders Group to the Interact Menu (via MD)
=============================================================
1. At `<event_ui_triggered screen="'Interact_Menu_API'" control="'reloaded'" />`, add the Custom Actions/Orders below.
2. Add the new Custom Actions/Orders Group Id `<raise_lua_event name="'Interact_Menu_API.Add_Custom_Actions_Group_Id'" param="'my_custom_actions_group_id'" />`
3. Add the new Custom Actions/Orders Group Name `<raise_lua_event name="'Interact_Menu_API.Add_Custom_Actions_Group_Text'" param="'My Custom Actions/Orders Group'" />`
4. Use the new id in Mod Support API's Add_Action function like this:
    ```xml
    ...
    	<signal_cue_instantly cue="md.Interact_Menu_API.Add_Action" param = "table[
    		$id = 'my_custom_action_1,
    		$section = 'my_custom_actions_group_id',
    		$text = 'My Custom Action 1',
    		$mouseover = 'My Custom Action 1 mouse over',
    		$callback = My_Custom_Action_1_Cue
    	]" />
    	<signal_cue_instantly cue="md.Interact_Menu_API.Add_Action" param = "table[
    		$id = 'my_custom_action_2,
    		$section = 'my_custom_actions_group_id',
    		$text = 'My Custom Action 1',
    		$mouseover = 'My Custom Action 2 mouse over',
    		$callback = My_Custom_Action_2_Cue
    	]" />
    ...
    ```
5. The custom commands will be added to both the Custom Actions and Custom Orders sub-menus.
6. To add only to one sub-menu and not the other, start the section name with either "actions_" or "orders_". E.g. "actions_my_custom_actions" will add the custom action to only the Custom Actions sub-menu. And "orders_my_custom_orders" will add the custom order to only the Custom Orders sub-menu.

Install
=======
- Unzip to 'X4 Foundations/extensions/kuertee_ui_extensions/'.

Uninstall
=========
- Delete the mod folder.

Troubleshooting
===============
1. Allow the game to log events to a text file by adding "-debug all -logfile debug.log" to its launch parameters.
2. If an Extension Options entry exists for the mod, enable the mod-specific Debug Log.
3. Play for long enough for the mod to log its events. Or force the error that you are experiencing.
4. Send the log found in My Documents\Egosoft\X4\(your player-specific number)\debug.log to my e-mail (kuertee@gmail.com) with the mod name in the subject line.

- New feature: new callback in menu map by Forleyor.
- New feature: new callback to prevent problems with Trade Analytics mod on ultra-wide monitors.

v7.5.02, 03 Mar 2025:
- Tweaks: Final merge of base-game 7.5 lua files into UI Extensions. The previous 7.5.01 version had the base-game 7.5 RC 4 lua files merged. They are very similar and no gameplay aspects would have been lost with the 7.5.01 version installed.

v7.5.01, 21 Feb 2025:
- Bug-fixes: 7.5 compatibility updates.

v7.5.0092 beta, 15 Feb 2025:
- Tweak: compatibility with 7.5 rc 1 of the base game.

v7.5.0091 beta, 12 Feb 2025:

v7.5.009 beta, 11 Feb 2025:
- Bug-fix: compatibility with the 7.5 beta 9 version of the base game.

v7.5.008 beta, 6 Feb 2025:
- Bug-fix: compatibility with the 7.5 beta 8 version of the base game.

v7.5.0071 beta, 5 Feb 2025:
- bug-fix: 7.5.007 update broke functions required by some mods (e.g. Alternatives to death, High-sec rooms are locked, Mod parts trader, et. al.)

v7.5.007 beta, 30 Jan 2025:
- Bug-fix: compatibility with the 7.5 beta 7 version of the base game.

v7.5.0063 beta, 29 Jan 2025:
- Bug-fix: Trade Rule Restrictions were not sticking.
- Bug-fix: Resizing Plot of stations were not sticking.

v7.5.0062 beta, 26 Jan 2025:
- New feature: <raise_lua_event name="'Interact_Menu_API.Existence_Query'" /> to identify existence of UIX by DrWhoKnows.
- New feature (merged from 7.1.19): UI callback, updatePlotSize_on_before_extend, in Map Menu for sticeIO's mod.

v7.5.0061 beta, 25 Jan 2025:
- New feature: 7.5 beta 6 compatibility.
- Bug-fix: The player's Inventory window wasn't opening.
- Tweak: The Online Features button is disabled. Because its functionality is natively disabled with how UI Extensions rewrites several menu files, the button might as well be disabled.
- Tweak: callbacks can now be assigned an id so that they can be deregistered by other mods with "menu.registerCallback(callbackName, myCallbackFunc, myId)".
				E.g.
				MapMenu.registerCallback("buttonToggleObjectList_on_start", myCallbackFunc, "mod_a").
				Then another lua file can do this:
				MapMenu.deregisterCallback("buttonToggleObjectList_on_start", nil, "mod_a").
				This is useful when you want to override another mod's custom changes to different menus with your own mod.
				Note that deregistering callbacks are delayed by 1 second because there is no method to ensure that the callback of another mod that is to be deregistered has been registered.
- New feature: callbacks of other mods can be updated (i.e. rerouted) to your own callbacks with "updateCallback(callbackName, id, myCallbackFunc)".
				E.g. Mod_a registered a callback for "buttonToggleObjectList_on_start" with the id "mod_a".
				And Mod_b wants to reroute that callback for its own function.
				That callback can be rerouted like this:
				MapMenu.updateCallback("buttonToggleObjectList_on_start", "mod_a", modb_CallbackFunc).
				Note that rerouted callbacks will keep their original ids.
				It might be better to deregister the callback THEN register the new callback instead.
				Also note that updating callbacks are delayed by 1 second because there is no method to ensure that the callback of another mod that is to be updated has been registered.

v7.1.18, 12 Jan 2025:
- New: UI Call-backs for the AEGS Faction mod by IALuir.

v7.1.17, 27 Dec 2024:
- New: French language file. Thanks, Calvitix!
- Bug-fix: Multi-rename function was sometimes still adding some objects (e.g. the sector) that shouldn't be renamed in the list of objects to rename.

v7.1.15, 11 Nov 2024:
- Bug-fix: The multi-rename feature was buggy. e.g. preventing the single-rename function from working. In this version, the right-clicked object needs to be in the selected list for the multi-rename button to be active.

v7.1.14, 7 Nov 2024:
- Bug-fix: The multi-rename feature was renaming a non-player-owned object if it was right-clicked on along with selected playerr objects.

v7.1.12, 2 Nov 2024:
- New feature: Rename multiple objects. More information in the Multi-rename section.
- New feature: The Custom Actions menu is shown when no menu is valid. E.g. when selecting multiple stations. Allows setting a station profile from the Trade Analytics mod to multiple stations at once.
- Tweak: Tweaked some callbacks for UT Advanced Renaming.

v7.1.11, 18 Oct 2024:
- Bug-fix: one more deregisterCallback bug.

v7.1.10, 17 Oct 2024:
- New callbacks: for an upcoming mod from NS.88.NS.
